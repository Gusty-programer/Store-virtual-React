# Virtual Store using localStorage

I built this project to deepen my knowledge of React. To use the data globally I used localStorage.
This project is currently in development. This is an online model kits store. Users can filter their search by categories (cars, planes, tanks, ships). Both the price and the promotional price are displayed. They can add products to the shopping cart or view the product in detail where the desired quantity can be changed.
In the shopping cart,
you can change the quantity, see the total price or remove products from the cart.
The products can be bought within the limit of the available stock.
